      "response_summary": "The Mughal Empire was a golden age of Indian history, spanning from the early 16th century to the mid-18th century. Founded by Babur, a Central Asian ruler, it saw the reigns of illustrious emperors like Akbar, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb. Mughal architecture, art, and cuisine are still celebrated today. What would you like to know more about - their politics, culture, or something else?",

      "response_summary": "The Mughal Empire's political landscape was shaped by the reigns of its emperors. Akbar is often credited with promoting religious tolerance and a centralized administration, while Shah Jahan oversaw significant architectural achievements, including the Taj Mahal. Aurangzeb, on the other hand, saw the empire decline due to his own rigid policies. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of Mughal politics?",
